# Cryptocurrencies  (Module 18 Challenge)

### Purpose
A classification system for new investments was created by examining what cryptocurrencies are traded on the market and how they could be grouped. Using scatter_3d(),hvplot.table(), and hvplot.scatter(), we were able to visualize the results after preprocessing the data for PCA, reducing the dimensions by PCA, clustering the cryptocurrencies by K-means, and plotting the results.
